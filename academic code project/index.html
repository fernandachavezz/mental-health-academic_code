        <h2>Guidance on Avoiding Academic Infractions</h2>
        <p>Maintaining mental health can help prevent academic infractions. A lot of students on campus often let the following stressors affect their mental health. Try to remember these tips:</p>
        
    <h3>General College Stressors</h3>
    <p><strong>Break Things Down:</strong> Focus on one task at a time. Big projects feel more manageable when broken into smaller steps.</p>
    <p><strong>Find a Routine That Works:</strong> A flexible yet consistent schedule can reduce stress and give structure to your day.</p>
    <p><strong>Reach Out:</strong> Never hesitate to ask for help. Talk to friends, professors, or advisors if you’re feeling overwhelmed.</p>

    <h3>Shame</h3>
    <p><strong>Remember, You're Not Alone:</strong> Everyone makes mistakes. Learning from them is part of the journey.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge Your Inner Critic:</strong> Instead of harsh self-talk, think about how you would comfort a friend—and show yourself that same compassion.</p>
    <p><strong>Talk to Someone:</strong> Sharing your feelings with a counselor or friend can help you gain perspective and move forward.</p>

    <h3>Homesickness/Culture Shock</h3>
    <p><strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Keep in touch with family and friends from home. A quick text can make a difference.</p>
    <p><strong>Create New Traditions:</strong> Start routines or traditions in your new environment to make it feel more like home.</p>
    <p><strong>Explore & Embrace:</strong> Seek out familiar places or try new experiences on campus to ease culture shock.</p>

    <h3>Seasonal Depression</h3>
    <p><strong>Stay Cozy and Comfortable:</strong> Layers are your friend! Always have a scarf, gloves, and a warm coat ready.</p>
    <p><strong>Plan for Seasonal Changes:</strong> If in a colder climate, try a light therapy lamp or cozy activities to lift your mood.</p>
    <p><strong>Stay Active Indoors:</strong> Short indoor workouts can help shake off the winter blues.</p>

    <h3>Burnout</h3>
    <p><strong>Prioritize Rest:</strong> Sometimes rest is the best productivity hack. Listen to your body and recharge.</p>
    <p><strong>Take Small Breaks:</strong> Step away from the screen every hour to stretch and clear your mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Reevaluate Commitments:</strong> See if there are responsibilities you can put on hold to lighten your load.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Being a Student and a Human</h3>
    <p><strong>Self-Care Is Productive:</strong> Eating, sleeping, and mental breaks aren’t just luxuries; they’re necessities.</p>
    <p><strong>Limit All-Nighters:</strong> Skipping sleep can impact focus and well-being. Try to prioritize rest.</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Treat yourself when you finish an assignment or have a good study session.</p>

    <h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
    <p><strong>Acknowledge Your Successes:</strong> Reflect on how much you’ve accomplished to reach this point—you’re here for a reason!</p>
    <p><strong>Focus on Growth, Not Perfection:</strong> Learning is about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself.</p>
    <p><strong>Find Your Support System:</strong> Surround yourself with friends and mentors who uplift you.</p>

    <h3>The Future </h3>
    <p><strong>One Step at a Time:</strong> Take it one decision, application, or step at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>
    <p><strong>Use Campus Resources:</strong> Career centers, counseling services, and alumni networks can help with career and adulting challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>It’s Normal to Feel Uncertain:</strong> Most people don’t have everything figured out, so take it easy on yourself.</p>

    <h3>Course Related Stressors</h3>
    <p><strong>Talk to Your Professor or TA:</strong> They’re there to help! Make use of office hours and ask questions.</p>
    <p><strong>Form Study Groups:</strong> Studying with peers can make difficult content more manageable and less intimidating.</p>
    <p><strong>Give Yourself Credit:</strong> Challenging yourself academically is a big deal. Celebrate your perseverance!</p>
